## Innovate Application Requirements
The Innovate application you will create in this module, must meet these requirements:

- Users must be able to submit ideas for innovations to processes, team building, and cost savings, so the company can benefit from their suggestions.
- Administrators must be able to determine from the records if the innovation was implemented, so a decision can be made about total cost savings.
- Administrators must be able to filter records by innovation type, keywords, and implementation status, so they can see which categories are receiving the most suggestions.
